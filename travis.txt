Yeah... ayy
Look,
I came from the dark, now I shine like the city,
Ice in my veins, I don't need no pity.
Hopped in the game like "who gon' stop me?",
Talk real slick but they move all sloppy.
Heart went cold like December nights,
Used to be broke, now I live that life.
Never went soft, just played it quiet,
Now I got bars like I’m startin’ a riot!
Drill in my blood, this is not for clout,
I was in pain, now I’m breakin’ out.
They was asleep, I was buildin’ fire,
Now I got dreams that be touchin’ the wire.
No fake friends, no snakes around,
I cut ‘em off – they was draggin’ me down.
Back then, they ain’t show me love,
Now they just prayin’ I don’t rise above.
I don’t flex, I just do,
Whole new world, new point of view.
Never been scared, I walk through hell,
Talk that talk but they know I’m real.
Drip all black like I’m dressin’ for war,
Beast in the booth, I don’t knock, I floor.
Climbed from the bottom, no cheat, no glitch,
Made my name, now I flip that switch.
I ain’t never need no handouts,
Every scar turned into a standout.
Every “no” turned into a route,
Now my silence louder than they shout.
I seen pain, I seen lies,
I seen hope fall from the skies.
But I still move, still stand tall,
Never let fear back me to a wall.
This that drill – not TikTok dance,
This that real – no second chance.
I came back with a darker heart,
Mind too sharp like a throwing dart.
New phase, no past to chase,
Only look back just to leave no trace.
This my time, this my pace,
I don’t fold – I embrace that race!
Yeah, came out the mud with a plan and a prayer,
Now they all watch but they never dare.
